# Bayesian nonparametric estimation of the probability of discovering new species (SLIDES)

This repository contains slides covering the paper [*Bayesian nonparametric estimation of the probability of discovering new species* by Lijoi, Mena, and Prünster (2007)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20441417?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents). A Julia implementation of the simulations described therein can be found [here](https://github.com/scortino/lijoi07).
